# Architecture and harness

Source: design v2 sections 4.3, 5, 6, 7 and 13; plan v2 M0; [schema amendment](https://github.com/stanimirivanov/kryvola-spec/blob/647986b9ba9cb2c6d3b853046272e3869b6fea5e/docs/adr/0001-schema-authoring.md).

Platform composes released artifacts from the other repositories; it does not own their cryptographic implementations. Unqualified profiles remain disabled. Kubernetes/Ray/broker identities cannot hold private decryption keys. No cloud, service or secret is provisioned by foundation checks.

| Requirement | Governed code/configuration | Evaluation | Limit / review |
|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime/module ownership | `src/` | Compiler/type checker and `tools/architecture.py` | Semantic responsibility remains code review |
| No sibling implementation source dependency | `pyproject.toml`, Python imports | Manifest/provenance check; isolated forbidden-local-source fixtures in tests | Dynamic imports/native calls and CMake dependency changes require review |
| Contracts come from spec | `spec.lock.json` and vendored artifacts | Commit/repository identity plus SHA-256 manifest/file integrity checks | Build provenance is not cryptographic authorization; update source and pin in a reviewed change |
| Reference-only bounded control | Generated contract preview | Effect-generated JSON Schema and negative fixtures | No native ciphertext decode, expanded-memory accounting or RPC payload guard yet |
| No unqualified production claim | `config/foundation.json` and inventory validator | Generated schema rejects enabled/unqualified and production_ready=true fixtures | No inference, crypto qualification or deployed stack |
| Reproducible setup / required checks | Toolchain pins, `uv.lock`, `tools/verify.py` | README fast/full commands, same commands in CI | Full cryptographic, hardware and operational gates remain deferred |
| Codex guidance | Root `AGENTS.md` | Git-root discovery applies through child working directories; no overrides | Client trust/activation is user-managed; no config or model override is installed |

The custom architecture tool examines declared dependencies and static Python imports, not arbitrary program behavior. Its isolated fixtures demonstrate both valid acceptance and representative failure, including nonzero CLI exit. Required inputs are never optional and failures propagate through the canonical task runner.

CI is configured on pull requests/main pushes with commit-pinned actions, `contents: read`, no persistent Git credentials and no production secrets. A hosted CI result is not claimed by configuration. Maintainers must enable required status checks (`verify`), review/branch rules and any desired repository security settings; no remote protections are changed here. Local hooks are not merge enforcement.

No `.codex/config.toml` or repository skill is needed for the current workflow. Root instructions link detailed sources on demand and preserve the configured model/reasoning effort. Scoped instruction files are unnecessary because responsibilities do not yet require different agent rules.

Platform may consume published packages/images from all four repositories, as required by design 4.3. Its guard rejects local source dependencies rather than incorrectly forbidding those approved artifact dependencies. Other runtime repositories reject foreign implementation imports and dependencies.
